# CourseHelperWeb
An app to help a teacher with an outline and some content ideas for a course given a set of instructions in a system agent and the user provided course plan.
The app should have a server handling the requests to OpenAI API and the system agent instructions.
User agent instructions should be sent in to the server via a REST API
The first front end for users should be a web page, with a form accepting a text or a file with the course contents.
The return should be presented nicely in the webpage and preferably be easy to copy.
An optional feature is delivery of a downloadable generated .pdf out from the page.
